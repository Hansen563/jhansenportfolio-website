        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I am a curious and creative individual with a strong passion for web development. I love learning new things and solving problems, and I am excited to use my skills to build beautiful and functional websites.

          Even though I don't have professional experience in the web industry, I have a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am also a quick learner and eager to take on new challenges.
          
          In addition to my web development skills, I am also a good communicator and collaborator. I am confident that I can work effectively with others to create high-quality products.
          
          In my free time, I enjoy reading manga, watching anime, and playing video games. I am also a big fan of science fiction and fantasy.

          <h1>HTML</h1>
          <p>I have a basic understanding of HTML, the standard markup <br> language for creating web pages. I can use HTML to structure <br>the content of a web page and define its appearance.

            I am still <br>learning about HTML, but I am eager to use my skills to build <br>beautiful and functional websites. I am also interested in learning <br> more about CSS and JavaScript, so that I can create more interactive <br>and dynamic web pages.

        <h1>CSS</h1>
        <p>I have a basic understanding of CSS, the Cascading Style Sheets <br>language used to style web pages. I can use CSS to control the <br>appearance of text, images, and other elements on a web page. <br>I can also use CSS to create layouts and to make web pages <br>responsive, so that they look good on all devices.

          I am still learning <br> about CSS, but I am eager to use my skills to create beautiful <br>and functional websites.
